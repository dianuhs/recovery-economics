# Memories

This folder is for small config and preference files (YAML/markdown) that describe
how your organization thinks about recovery, risk, and tradeoffs.

Example ideas:
- default discount rates for downtime
- which business units are most sensitive to outages
- default assumptions about AI-assisted runbooks
